Q: How many additions are performed when we compute the nth Fibonacci number
using the definition of fibs based on the add-streams procedure?

A: n

Show that the number of additions would be exponentially greater
if we had implemented (delay <exp>) simply as (lambda () <exp>),
without using the optimization provided by the memo-proc procedure
